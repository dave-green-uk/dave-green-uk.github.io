    "bio": [
      "I've spent the past 15 years in web and product development, focused on WordPress and WooCommerce, building and overseeing the delivery of everything from bespoke websites and integrations to custom plugins and impactful product features.",
      "After over a decade in the agency world, I moved into product development—first as a product engineer, and now as a product owner—where I combine technical insight with strategic execution, translating user needs into actionable product stories and delivering product roadmaps that achieve business goals.",
      "My experience in development and support means I’m comfortable diving into technical details when needed — triaging new issues, conducting QA, and supporting smooth feature and maintenance releases — while maintaining focus on broader product strategy.",
      "I'm passionate about helping teams deliver results by removing blockers, accelerating progress, and turning strategy into action. Pragmatic, adaptable, and a strong cross-team communicator, I thrive in environments where initiative and continuous improvement matter."
